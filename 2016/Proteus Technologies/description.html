<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 23.4px;">Initially founded in 1995 in Atlanta, GA USA, Proteus Technologies was a technology consulting service headed by Benjamin Scherrey. Generally engaged for innovative or technically challenging projects, the majority of our efforts centered around helping the client build it&#39;s own development team and capabilities in house. Wanting to build his own team without the corporate politics and as an experiment to confirm his hypothesis that the lack of innovative Asian software groups was primarily due to the lack of technical career paths, Mr. Scherrey moved to Thailand and built the first development group 100% focused on Agile processes.</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 23.4px;">The Proteus Group now consists of three organizations plus external partners:</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 23.4px;">Proteus Technologies Pte. Ltd., founded in 2008, is SEAsia&#39;s premiere Agile software development group. Focusing on startup and innovation projects, we primarily build web services using Python/Django on Linux environments for clients around the world. However we are not a one-trick organization and always strive to apply the most appropriate technologies to fulfill the architectural drivers for the project. We&#39;ve been on the bleeding edge in web services, real-time event/chat &amp; live streaming, mobile systems, telecom, and even big data &amp; mashable statistics. The result is a team of over 20 people who have more technical breadth and experience in delivering cutting edge solutions than most people imagine exist in Asia. Led by two experienced software architects from the United States and United Kingdom, we have a world class offering with a unique value proposition. Our specialty is to help our clients build their own development team and Agile processes as they cooperate with us in building their core products. Once the first release is deployed the client not only has a strong product but also a strong team capable of taking their product forward and in control of their own destiny.</span></p>
