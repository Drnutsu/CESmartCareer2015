		<p>operated in our Bangkok timezone. Our US clients submit requests during their day, and we take care&nbsp;</p>

		<p>of it while they sleep. Overall the system works, but we want to turn it up a notch by providing support&nbsp;</p>

		<p>during US hours.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve thought about different ways to solve this challenge: open up a US office? Outsource to the&nbsp;</p>

		<p>client satisfaction; and as a front-line position you bear a deep responsibility to ensure that our clients&nbsp;</p>

		<p>This position is not for the faint of heart. We are not interested in ho-hum &ldquo;customer support&nbsp;</p>

		<p>representatives&rdquo; looking to fill a job until they find something better. Ideally, a night shift position is&nbsp;</p>

		<p>what you&rsquo;re already looking for, as it frees up your afternoons and lets you be the true night owl you&nbsp;</p>

		<p>really are.</p>

		<p>We are open to your ideas and suggestions. If this is something that interests you, but you&rsquo;d like to&nbsp;</p>

		<p>change the hours a bit, or only work certain days of the week - let us know. We can work together to&nbsp;</p>

		<p>reach the ideal solution for our clients and your schedule.</p>

		<p>Qualifications</p>

		<p> Strong English proficiency with excellent writing and communications skills</p>

		<p> A keen eye for detail and quality. You&rsquo;ll have the final responsibility for quality control</p>

		<p> A team player and know how to work with a cross-cultural team</p>
